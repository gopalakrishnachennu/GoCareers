If you don't remember the passwords, you can reset any of them by running this command:

bash
python3 manage.py changepassword admin
Or if you want to create a brand new superuser with a fresh password:

bash
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
Want me to reset the password for any of these accounts right now?
