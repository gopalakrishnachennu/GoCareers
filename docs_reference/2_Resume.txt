Community

Community Health Network was created by our neighbors, for our neighbors. Over 60 years later, “community” is still the heart of our organization. It means providing our neighbors with the best care possible, backed by state-of-the-art technology. It means getting involved in the communities we serve through volunteer opportunities and benefits initiatives. It means ensuring our dedicated caregivers can learn and grow to stay at the top of their fields and to better serve our patients. And above all, it means exceptional care, simply delivered — and we couldn’t do it without you.
